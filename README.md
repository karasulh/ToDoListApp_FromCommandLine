This repo is a basic To Do App by using Command Line Interface(CLI). By running our application with necessary arguments which are action and task, our task states are updated in todo.db file. 
You must use "add", "start", "done" as action. Task also should be a string.

- to run it like: **cargo run add "work hard sleep less"**
- to run it like: **cargo run start "work hard sleep less"**
- to run it like: **cargo run done "work hard sleep less"**
- to run it like  **cargo run add "write a rust project"**

**todo.db** file becomes like:
work hard sleep less : Done
write a rust project : To Do
